    "# ResNet34 Model for Fashion MNIST\n",
    "This model is the realization of the first object of this project, which was to create a deep neural network model which, when trained on the Fashion MNIST training dataset, could achieve an accuracy of 90% when classifying on the corresponding testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is one called a residual network (ResNet). Most other networks 'linearily' pass down the information of an image through various levels of convulational filters and pooling layers. The uniquesnss of a ResNet is that it sums the output of convulational layers within 'blocks' of them as the features travel through. That way there is no issue of disappearing gradient, increasing the accuracy and performance of the model. \n",
